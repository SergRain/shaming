              The human toll is devastating and like other global businesses, we
              are committed to supporting our Ukrainian team members, customers
              and partners. We are also seeking to support non-Ukraine-based
              employees with family members located in Ukraine with information
              to access available resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              We continue to support our employees in Russia, as they are
              adversely impacted by the consequences of their government’s
              actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The suspension of operations includes suspension of all sales,
              support, and professional services in both countries in line with
              VMware’s commitment to comply with sanctions and restrictions.

          How the war is funded
        </h2>

        <div class="fundation__item">
          <div class="fundation__text">
            <p>
              In Russia, there is an autocratic regime of Vladimir Putin. All of Russia's biggest oligarchies, bankers,
              and manufacturers are his foothold. That is why they are sanctioned by the US and EU.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vladimir Putin uses every Russian manufactory, every dollar or euro of investments of every citizen of
              this
              country as a weapon to grow the military forces, depress the freedom of Russian citizens, commit war
              crimes,
              and encourage genocide of Ukrainians.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any big manufacturing or service industries in Russia are the support of Putin's regime. Supplying
              anything
              there (selling, providing services/technologies/investments), you become the same support for Putin's
              regime
              and collaborator of Putin's crimes.
            </p>
          </div>

            <p>
              It's not a business as usual. Because there is no usual business in Russia. It's cooperation in a crime.
              Cooperation in killing Ukrainians who resist Putin's regime.
            </p>
            <p>
              Putin is not fighting with weapons by himself and not doing war crimes alone. Any russian factory that
              produces tanks which shoot peaceful Ukrainian houses or rockets which bomb refugees at train stations,
              needs deliveries from hundreds of US and EU factories for continuing activities. Without these supplies,
              the factory can't produce a tank, a rocket or a bomb. Someone is making machines for Putin, someone -
              microcircuits, someone delivers raw materials, someone - payment methods, and someone is paying for the
              raw materials with money.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="fundation__item">
          <div class="fundation__text">
            <p>
              Ukrainians are dying while trying to stop a russian tank and hide their children from rockets. But russian
              tank can be stopped in another way, so the same as russian rocket to stop flying. Russian tank can just
              not ride out of the factory. And what's even better is not to let this factory function and not let Putin
              have the opportunity to pay for this tank or rocket.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ukrainians are begging for peace, sympathy, and asking for your help. Business with Russia leads a company
              to become a cooperator of Putin's crimes. Dear “company name”, don't cooperate with Putin. Save Ukraine
              from the war and Ukrainian children from deaths.

            Ukrainians won't forget their murderers and will remember all of them, similar to how Jewish remembered all
            the followers of Hitler who made the Holocaust. Ukrainians won't also forget Putin's collaborators in these
            crimes. Any money or contracts aren't worth the shame with that you would have to look into your child's
            eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ukrainians bravely protect their towns from the dictator who threatens the world with nuclear war. Does the
            business of "company name" worth their lives?
          </p>
          <p>
            Every russian rocket was built and paid for through the technologies of foreign companies. Now, when these
            rockets kill Ukrainian citizens and children, would you still continue cooperating with Russia, "company
            name"?
