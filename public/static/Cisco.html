              <p>
                It's difficult to overestimate the significance of CISCO equipment for Russia. In general, now almost
                20% of the entire Russian network infrastructure is running on CISCO solutions. All the more or less
                complex network infrastructure in any serious company uses solutions from CISCO. The Russian payment
                system MIR, which Russia uses after the decision of Visa and Mastercard to stop working there, is built
                on CISCO solutions. Sberbank of Russia also uses CISCO solutions in its data centers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, according to an investigation published in 2015, Cisco changed the names of Russian customers
                in its
                documentation to supply equipment to Roscosmos, the FSB, the Ministry of Defense, and pretty much every
                major data center in the Russian Federation despite the sanctions of Europe and the United States.
                Thus, Cisco products can be used by the Russian Federation for aggressive actions, including
                cyberattacks during hostilities on the territory of Ukraine and installing communication between Russian
                divisions.
              </p>

            </div>

            <div class="hero__info_text">
              <p>
                Cisco Chief Executive Chuck Robbins told staff in a letter that "Cisco is stopping all business
                operations in Russia and Belarus... We stand with Ukraine and condemn this unjustified war."
              </p>
              <p>
                If CISCO really withdrew from Russia, the consequences for the Putin regime would be very noticeable.
                These consequences would affect, to a large extent, the Russian state-owned companies and Putin's
                oligarchs who use industrial solutions from CISCO.
              </p>
              <p>
                And we don't see these businesses' operations being disrupted in any way.
              </p>
              <p>
                This indicates that CISCO equipment is still being maintained. Thus, CISCO works not just directly with
                customers but also through a vast network of dealers and distributors who engage with CISCO on a regular
                basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                For Cisco, the Russian market is not even the main source of income, it covers only is 1% of Cisco's
                total revenue. Yet, while continuing to work in the Russia, Cisco keeps on directly sponsoring Russia's
                military aggression.

          How the war is funded

          <div class="fundation__text">
            <p>
              In Russia, Vladimir Putin has built an autocratic regime. He uses all the oligarchs, bankers, and large
              manufacturers as a foothold. That is why the US and EU sanctioned most of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vladimir Putin uses every Russian manufactory, every dollar or euro of investments, and every ruble paid
              as a tax in Russia as means to grow the military force, depress the freedom of Russian citizens, commit
              war crimes, and encourage genocide of Ukrainians.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any big manufacturing or service industry in Russia is automatically supporting Putin's regime. Supplying
              anything to Russia, whether it is services, technologies, or investments, you invest in Putin's military
              power and fuel Putin's war machine with your money.
            </p>
          </div>

              It's not just a business. Because there is no usual business in Russia anymore. Since Russia is
              responsible for the war in Ukraine, cooperating with Russia means joining the crime. It means cooperating
              with Russia in killing Ukrainians who resist Putin's regime.
            </p>
            <p>
              Putin is not fighting with weapons by himself and not doing war crimes alone. All the Russian factories
              that produce tanks that shoot peaceful Ukrainian houses or missiles that shell refugees at train stations
              require supplies from US and EU factories to continue their activities. Without these supplies, the
              factories cannot manufacture tanks, missiles, and war machines. Supporting Putin’s war can have many
              shapes: it can be selling microcircuits to middle-size Russian companies, delivering raw materials that
              can be later sold to other companies, or even simply paying money for any Russian goods or services.

              Ukrainians are dying while trying to stop Russian tanks and hide their children from Russian missiles. But
              Russian tanks and missiles can be stopped in another way. It is possible to make the Russian tanks stay
              unused or unassembled at the factory. Or, even better, to make such a Russian factory stop completely or
              to make it impossible for Putin to pay for tanks and missiles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ukrainians are begging for peace, sympathy, and asking for your help. Doing business with Russia while it
              still wages the war makes a company a Putin's criminal partner. Dear Cisco, don't cooperate with
              Putin. Save Ukraine from the war. Save Ukrainian children and help them stay alive.

                In Russia, there are no independent businesses. Russia is a system of oligarchs and law enforcement that
                cover up tyranny and one another. As a result, nearly all Russian oligarchs are subject to EU and US
                sanctions. Cooperation with them and their companies entails cooperation with Putin’s regime and
                maintaining its viability.

                Purchasing resources in Russia is a direct investment in war. Any company doing business in Russia and
                paying taxes to the Russian government is funding the war.
