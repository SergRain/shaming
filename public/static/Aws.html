                Amazon’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), announced that it has no data centres,
                infrastructure, or offices in Russia, and has a long-standing policy of not doing business with the
                Russian government. Although AWS declared that it is no longer accepting new customers based in Russia
                or Belarus and will block new AWS sign-ups there following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the company
                still left the room to support the existing customers in Russia.

              <p>
                Amazon justifies itself with the fact that its biggest clients using AWS in Russia are headquartered
                elsewhere, with development teams in the country. But this explanation seems unconvincing. As large AWS
                clients continue to fill the Russian budget with money that is then used to finance the war.
              </p>

              <p>
                Russia accounts for a fraction of 1% of AWS overall business. From the perspective of AWS, cutting off
                Russian customers would have little effect. But for those customers, it could still be painful.

          How the war is funded

        <div class="fundation__item">
          <div class="fundation__text">
            <p>
              In Russia, Vladimir Putin has built an autocratic regime. He uses all the oligarchs, bankers, and large
              manufacturers as a foothold. That is why the US and EU sanctioned most of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vladimir Putin uses every Russian manufactory, every dollar or euro of investments, and every ruble paid
              as a tax in Russia as means to grow the military force, depress the freedom of Russian citizens, commit
              war crimes, and encourage genocide of Ukrainians.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any big manufacturing or service industry in Russia is automatically supporting Putin's regime. Supplying
              anything to Russia, whether it is services, technologies, or investments, you invest in Putin's military
              power and fuel Putin's war machine with your money.
            </p>
          </div>

              It's not just a business. Because there is no usual business in Russia anymore. Since Russia is
              responsible for the war in Ukraine, cooperating with Russia means joining the crime. It means cooperating
              with Russia in killing Ukrainians who resist Putin's regime.
            </p>
            <p>
              Putin is not fighting with weapons by himself and not doing war crimes alone. All the Russian factories
              that produce tanks that shoot peaceful Ukrainian houses or missiles that shell refugees at train stations
              require supplies from US and EU factories to continue their activities. Without these supplies, the
              factories cannot manufacture tanks, missiles, and war machines. Supporting Putin’s war can have many
              shapes: it can be selling microcircuits to middle-size Russian companies, delivering raw materials that
              can be later sold to other companies, or even simply paying money for any Russian goods or services.
            </p>

              Ukrainians are dying while trying to stop Russian tanks and hide their children from Russian missiles. But
              Russian tanks and missiles can be stopped in another way. It is possible to make the Russian tanks stay
              unused or unassembled at the factory. Or, even better, to make such a Russian factory stop completely or
              to make it impossible for Putin to pay for tanks and missiles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ukrainians are begging for peace, sympathy, and asking for your help. Doing business with Russia while it
              still wages the war makes a company a Putin's criminal partner. Dear AWS, don't cooperate with
              Putin. Save Ukraine from the war. Save Ukrainian children and help them stay alive.

                In Russia, there are no independent businesses. Russia is a system of oligarchs and law enforcement that
                cover up tyranny and one another. As a result, nearly all Russian oligarchs are subject to EU and US
                sanctions. Cooperation with them and their companies entails cooperation with Putin’s regime and
                maintaining its viability.

                Purchasing resources in Russia is a direct investment in war. Any company doing business in Russia and
                paying taxes to the Russian government is funding the war.
