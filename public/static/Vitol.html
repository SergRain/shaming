              Commodities traders such as Trafigura and Vitol have helped keep
              Russia's oil flowing through its Baltic and Black Sea ports in
              March, when some Western firms started to snub the market,
              according to ship tracking, traders and shipping sources.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both Swiss-based trading houses have long-term deals with
              state-run Russian oil giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) to load crude under
              agreements struck before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine triggered a
              wave of Western sanctions this month.
            </p>
            <p>
              So far in March, the two companies combined have loaded 22 cargoes
              of Urals crude, equivalent to 2.32 million tonnes of oil or 16.7
              million barrels, according to Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking data
              and sources. They shipped 1.84 million tonnes in February and 1.80
              million in January.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bulk of the oil the two companies buy comes from Rosneft,
              though a large chunk of the crude Vitol handles via Russian ports
              comes from Kazakh producers.

              Galp deplores the Russian acts of aggression against the
              people of Ukraine. Galp’s Board of Directors has therefore
              decided to suspend all new purchases of petroleum products
              either sourced in Russia or from Russian companies. Although
              Galp has no joint ventures with any Russian entities, Galp is
              also in the process of eliminating direct or indirect exposure
              to petroleum products either sourced in Russia or from Russian
              companies in existing contracts. Although this measure will
              impact the Sines operations and its likely financial
              contribution, Galp will continue to ensure the supply of gas
              and fuels to the Portuguese market.
            </p>
            <p>
              Galp’s Chairman, Paula Amorim, underlines that “this terrible
              act of aggression by Russia against Ukraine absolutely
              violates the values that Galp defends, such as freedom and
              human rights. In such a complex and terrible context, our
              decision is simple: Galp will not contribute to finance war”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Galp’s CEO, Andy Brown, highlights: “Russia’s massive invasion
              of Ukraine represents a harsh blow to the free world. Our
              sympathy is with the Ukrainian people who are suffering this
              aggression. We are looking at how Galp can support the
              collective humanitarian efforts”.

          How the war is funded
        </h2>

        <div class="fundation__item">
          <div class="fundation__text">
            <p>
              In Russia, Vladimir Putin has built an autocratic regime. He uses all the oligarchs, bankers, and large
              manufacturers as a foothold. That is why the US and EU sanctioned most of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vladimir Putin uses every Russian manufactory, every dollar or euro of investments, and every ruble paid
              as a tax in Russia as means to grow the military force, depress the freedom of Russian citizens, commit
              war crimes, and encourage genocide of Ukrainians.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any big manufacturing or service industry in Russia is automatically supporting Putin's regime. Supplying
              anything to Russia, whether it is services, technologies, or investments, you invest in Putin's military
              power and fuel Putin's war machine with your money.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="fundation__image">

          <div class="fundation__text">
            <p>
              It's not just a business. Because there is no usual business in Russia anymore. Since Russia is
              responsible for the war in Ukraine, cooperating with Russia means joining the crime. It means cooperating
              with Russia in killing Ukrainians who resist Putin's regime.
            </p>
            <p>
              Putin is not fighting with weapons by himself and not doing war crimes alone. All the Russian factories
              that produce tanks that shoot peaceful Ukrainian houses or missiles that shell refugees at train stations
              require supplies from US and EU factories to continue their activities. Without these supplies, the
              factories cannot manufacture tanks, missiles, and war machines. Supporting Putin’s war can have many
              shapes: it can be selling microcircuits to middle-size Russian companies, delivering raw materials that
              can be later sold to other companies, or even simply paying money for any Russian goods or services.
            </p>

        <div class="fundation__item">

            <p>
              Ukrainians are dying while trying to stop Russian tanks and hide their children from Russian missiles. But
              Russian tanks and missiles can be stopped in another way. It is possible to make the Russian tanks stay
              unused or unassembled at the factory. Or, even better, to make such a Russian factory stop completely or
              to make it impossible for Putin to pay for tanks and missiles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ukrainians are begging for peace, sympathy, and asking for your help. Doing business with Russia while it
              still wages the war makes a company a Putin's criminal partner. Dear Vitol, don't cooperate with
              Putin. Save Ukraine from the war. Save Ukrainian children and help them stay alive.

            Ukrainians won't forget and won’t forgive those who are responsible for the deaths of their loved ones. Just
            like Jewish people didn’t forgive Hitler's followers who were responsible for Holocaust, Ukrainians won't
            forget and forgive Putin's collaborators in these crimes. Any money a company gets for working with Putin’s
            regime won’t be enough to get rid of the shame once you need to explain to your children why you were
            working with Russia when it was shelling peaceful cities.
