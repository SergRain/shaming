            <div class="hero__info_text">
              <p>
                "Thales offers enterprise-wide solutions for identity management, data protection, key management, and
                high assurance hardware to secure data in use, in transit and at rest. Thales has already established a
                strong presence in Russia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thales e-Security is a critical provider of cloud solutions, servers, and authorization systems for
                state-owned banks in Russia. For example, Alfa Bank relies on Thales’s SafeNet eToken USB Authenticator
                for digital access to ensure the highest standards of security. However, Alfa Bank is under sanctions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Probably, Thales did not stop from cooperating even despite some of its clients were in the
                Russian-occupied Crimea. Tenders published in the public domain in 2019 show that one of Russia's
                national commercial banks placed orders in Thales, clearly indicating that the region of service will be
                Crimea.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PayShield system from Thales, that is widely used in the global payments ecosystem by issuers,
                service providers, acquirers, processors, and payment networks,
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="hero__info_text">
              <p>
                is used by many state-owned banks of the
                Russian Federation: PJSC CB ""VOSTOCHNY"", PJSC Rosgosstrakh Bank, JSC BANK ""SNGB"", Headquarters of
                PJSC Sberbank, The Bank of Moscow, and VTB Bank.
                The most interesting part is that the sanctioned Moscow Credit Bank issues tender No. 59703323 for the
                procurement of Thales payShield equipment on April 18, 2022. At that time, the aggression that Russia
                had started in Ukraine in 2022 had been going on for almost two months. The world has already seen the
                consequences of Russia's genocide in the Ukrainian cities of Bucha, Irpin, and Borodyanka. More than 50
                people were killed when a Russian missile struck the Kramatorsk railway station.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to a media investigation, Thales has supplied Russia with its Catherine FC thermal imagers for
                modernizing an amphibious infantry fighting vehicle BMD-4M.The thermal imagers were manufactured in
                2016, while the sanctions prohibiting selling dual-use products to the Russian Federation were imposed
                in 2014."

          How the war is funded

          <div class="fundation__text">
            <p>
              In Russia, Vladimir Putin has built an autocratic regime. He uses all the oligarchs, bankers, and large
              manufacturers as a foothold. That is why the US and EU sanctioned most of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vladimir Putin uses every Russian manufactory, every dollar or euro of investments, and every ruble paid
              as a tax in Russia as means to grow the military force, depress the freedom of Russian citizens, commit
              war crimes, and encourage genocide of Ukrainians.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any big manufacturing or service industry in Russia is automatically supporting Putin's regime. Supplying
              anything to Russia, whether it is services, technologies, or investments, you invest in Putin's military
              power and fuel Putin's war machine with your money.
            </p>
          </div>

              It's not just a business. Because there is no usual business in Russia anymore. Since Russia is
              responsible for the war in Ukraine, cooperating with Russia means joining the crime. It means cooperating
              with Russia in killing Ukrainians who resist Putin's regime.
            </p>
            <p>
              Putin is not fighting with weapons by himself and not doing war crimes alone. All the Russian factories
              that produce tanks that shoot peaceful Ukrainian houses or missiles that shell refugees at train stations
              require supplies from US and EU factories to continue their activities. Without these supplies, the
              factories cannot manufacture tanks, missiles, and war machines. Supporting Putin’s war can have many
              shapes: it can be selling microcircuits to middle-size Russian companies, delivering raw materials that
              can be later sold to other companies, or even simply paying money for any Russian goods or services.
            </p>

              Ukrainians are dying while trying to stop Russian tanks and hide their children from Russian missiles. But
              Russian tanks and missiles can be stopped in another way. It is possible to make the Russian tanks stay
              unused or unassembled at the factory. Or, even better, to make such a Russian factory stop completely or
              to make it impossible for Putin to pay for tanks and missiles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ukrainians are begging for peace, sympathy, and asking for your help. Doing business with Russia while it
              still wages the war makes a company a Putin's criminal partner. Dear Thales, don't cooperate with
              Putin. Save Ukraine from the war. Save Ukrainian children and help them stay alive.

          WHY DOES OPERATING IN RUSSIA MEAN FINANCING THE WAR?

                In Russia, there are no independent businesses. Russia is a system of oligarchs and law enforcement that
                cover up tyranny and one another. As a result, nearly all Russian oligarchs are subject to EU and US
                sanctions. Cooperation with them and their companies entails cooperation with Putin’s regime and
                maintaining its viability.
              </li>
              <li>
                Purchasing resources in Russia is a direct investment in war. Any company doing business in Russia and
                paying taxes to the Russian government is funding the war.

                Putin funds the war with every available material resource, technology, and ruble from the economy. That
                goes to build tanks, weapons, and military planes dumping bombs on Ukrainian cities; and missiles
                destroying schools, maternity hospitals, and residential buildings in Ukraine.
              </li>
              <li>
                There is no more business as usual with Russia. Because there is no such thing as usual business there
                anymore.
