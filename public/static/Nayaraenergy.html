              NEW DELHI, March 23 (Reuters) - Indian private refiner Nayara
              Energy, part-owned by Russia's Rosneft (ROSN.MM), has purchased
              Russian oil after a gap of a year, buying about 1.8 million
              barrels of Urals from trader Trafigura, two trade sources said and
              Refinitiv data shows.
            </p>
            <p>
              Indian companies are snapping up Russian oil as it is available at
              a deep discount after some companies and countries shunned
              purchases from Moscow due to sanctions over its invasion of
              Ukraine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nayara's deal, struck after Russia launched what it calls a
              "special operation" in Ukraine on Feb. 24, involves use of
              Liberia-flagged aframax Moskovsky Prospect, managed by a unit of
              Russia's state-run shipping firm Sovcomflot (FLOT.MM), Refinitiv
              data show.

          How the war is funded
        </h2>

        <div class="fundation__item">
          <div class="fundation__text">
            <p>
              In Russia, Vladimir Putin has built an autocratic regime. He uses all the oligarchs, bankers, and large
              manufacturers as a foothold. That is why the US and EU sanctioned most of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vladimir Putin uses every Russian manufactory, every dollar or euro of investments, and every ruble paid
              as a tax in Russia as means to grow the military force, depress the freedom of Russian citizens, commit
              war crimes, and encourage genocide of Ukrainians.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any big manufacturing or service industry in Russia is automatically supporting Putin's regime. Supplying
              anything to Russia, whether it is services, technologies, or investments, you invest in Putin's military
              power and fuel Putin's war machine with your money.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="fundation__image">

          <div class="fundation__text">
            <p>
              It's not just a business. Because there is no usual business in Russia anymore. Since Russia is
              responsible for the war in Ukraine, cooperating with Russia means joining the crime. It means cooperating
              with Russia in killing Ukrainians who resist Putin's regime.
            </p>
            <p>
              Putin is not fighting with weapons by himself and not doing war crimes alone. All the Russian factories
              that produce tanks that shoot peaceful Ukrainian houses or missiles that shell refugees at train stations
              require supplies from US and EU factories to continue their activities. Without these supplies, the
              factories cannot manufacture tanks, missiles, and war machines. Supporting Putin’s war can have many
              shapes: it can be selling microcircuits to middle-size Russian companies, delivering raw materials that
              can be later sold to other companies, or even simply paying money for any Russian goods or services.
            </p>

        <div class="fundation__item">

            <p>
              Ukrainians are dying while trying to stop Russian tanks and hide their children from Russian missiles. But
              Russian tanks and missiles can be stopped in another way. It is possible to make the Russian tanks stay
              unused or unassembled at the factory. Or, even better, to make such a Russian factory stop completely or
              to make it impossible for Putin to pay for tanks and missiles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ukrainians are begging for peace, sympathy, and asking for your help. Doing business with Russia while it
              still wages the war makes a company a Putin's criminal partner. Dear Nayara Energy, don't cooperate with
              Putin. Save Ukraine from the war. Save Ukrainian children and help them stay alive.

            Ukrainians won't forget and won’t forgive those who are responsible for the deaths of their loved ones. Just

            regime won’t be enough to get rid of the shame once you need to explain to your children why you were
